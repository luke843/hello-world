# hello-world

Hello guys.

Luke here, I am new to all of this, I'm a sopohomore in college, and majoring in computer science. I haven't taken any of the classes yet because I wanted to get all my gen-eds out the way first. I want to start with Python as my first language, also I don't have any friends in this field so i'm looking for some poeple to kind of help/guide me throughout this learning process.
